## Project Goals and Objectives:
- Predict awards voting results (Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the year) and the probability of each team entering the playoffs of current year, based on their previous performance.
- Design a web application to help fans get the prediction results and statistics of the players and teams.

## Datasets
The dataset is downloaded from www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats. The data was scraped from basketball-reference.com, one of the greatest comprehensive basketball stats site. We also use NBA_API to get the latest data and make predictions using pre-trained machine learning models.
